Thank you for your interest!

First thing first, read [DESIGN.md](https://github.com/GetBallot/mobile/blob/master/DESIGN.md) to understand how the project is structured.

## Compiling

1. Set up [Flutter](https://flutter.io/).
2. Acquire an API key for [Google Civic Information API
](https://developers.google.com/civic-information/docs/using_api).
3. Put Google API key in `lib/credentials.dart`.
4. Run `git update-index --assume-unchanged lib/credentials.dart` so you do not check in your credentials accidentally.
